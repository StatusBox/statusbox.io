                StatusBox is a service that helps you setup monitoring stack for scheduled tasks and cron jobs.
                Failed recurrent or scheduled job often stays unnoticed for some time and can easily lead to unpredicted
                consequences.
            </p>

            <p>We can help you to monitor and debug some of your jobs, such as:</p>
            <ul class="p-list">
                <li>video transcoding tasks</li>
                <li>data processors</li>
                <li>workers from task queues</li>
                <li>database backups</li>
                <li>reports generators</li>
                <li>ETL pipelines</li>
                <li>SSL renewal scripts</li>
                <li>and many more!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We collect <strong>tasks execution history</strong> and <strong>logs</strong> per each job for further
                analysis and <strong>send you notifications</strong> if something goes wrong (like failed job,
                not started cron job or in case of some error happened).
            </p>

            <p>We provide simple to use and integrate REST API and web-based dashboard.</p>
